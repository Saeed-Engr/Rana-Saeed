       <p><b> Prime Minister of Pakistan</b></p>
               I am a citizan of Pakistan. Hello everyone Assalamualaikum is there 1.3 billion Muslims
      in this world there are millions of Muslims living in other countries your parent countries in the 
       US as minorities since 1911 has grown at a place where it is alarming human communities live together they
        should be understanding amongst them but it is creating Muslim women wearing Hijab become an issue if
         become an issue in some countries job is some sort of a weapon a woman can take off her clothes in countries
     but she cannot put on more cloth how this after 9/11 and why it's because best leaders equated with Islam
    what is radical Islam there is only one Islam at that we follow of Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu there 
    is no other radical Islamic terrorism what message did they send to people in the west and why is there is
    no matter how is the person in New York in the Midwest in the US and European capital how is he going to 
     distinguish between who is moderate Woodland and who is the radical Islamic terrorism has nothing to do 
    with their with any religion their Islamic terrorism Islamic radicalism and Stanley used by leader
   this has then main reason for this is nomophobia and it has called pain among Muslims in Muslim countries
     what is islamophobia travelling abroad at its getting worse and I just say Mr president that in 
   European countries is marginalising Muslim communities and we all know that marginalisation
      leads to radicalization form of the people who and and and minute hands inside but Param marginalisation 
   from countries and point here is that we address this issue I am sad to say that we have Muslim 
      leaders have not addressed this issue is that after 9/11 then they came about that works 
      namely Don trying to explain to the best that there is no such thing as in all countries
         ornament communities they are already gone they are liberals and onto their communities.</p>




        <p ID="ISLAM">
     <p><b> Islamophobia </b> </p>
                       I am of substance action of the people in the West who delete deliberate worked this
       knowing the impact it would have but the majority of the people in the best did not understand this is there
      again Muslim leadership left the Muslims don't be we should have explained to them at a profit peace be upon
    him at peace be upon him mean to use show in 1 minute explain what he means to use of traffic was the witness
        to the the world book The holy Quran the Holy Quran is the book of guidance for wooden that the prophets 
    learn was leaving the Quran he was an example of what the Quran guide of to be so he is the idea we are 
   trying to get to to the prophet created the state of Madina the first state in Islam that that state of 
   the basis of a Muslim which became the predominant 700 years what was their state such range things about 
    Islam that it is against women if against minorities the first state of Islam in Madina it was the first time
    ever tested of set up the state responsibility of the week Window for 4 people and he captured text the rich
      and the money on the state announced that all children of atom hence equal whatever the the profit announced 
     that and salary the whole system depend on salary as it did for many years in the Western societies the 
   prophet said that one of the greatest did is to 40% but it because the socialist society depend on salary is
    said but if you have to treat them and an equal member of the family and as a result something happening in
     a Muslim world which has not happened in any other physician sadev then appeared became King the celebs who 
   became ruler Jap 10 India there was then and then again you hear that is law is supposed to be against me 
    not to let me just make the screen in Islam the prophet announced that everyone was practiced his religion
     it was a duty to protect the places of worship of all religion in announced that every person is equal in 
   front of law whatever his religion or his colour and this incredible and I always called this that the 
    fourth Khalifa the head of the state of Madina lost or case a court case against a jellyfish citizen so
   number 1 it showed there was a rule of law no no one was about law and numbers to that a Jivesh Citizen on
         an equal citizen .</p>
